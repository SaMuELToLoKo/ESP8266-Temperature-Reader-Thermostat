Arduino skecth To set Up an ESP8266 to get temperature with a DHT22, this is implemented with the follow sketch
https://github.com/SaMuELToLoKo/ESP8266-homebridge-advanced-thermostat.git

To get full working your Thermostat based in the plugin homebridge-advanced-thermostat. You can find it here.

With this three complements you can build a complete wireless thermostate.

I would like to implement some extra functions in a future like battery check to get it totally wirless and safe-energy mode.

Any help is well received.

Thank you to try it!!
